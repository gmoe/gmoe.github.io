This might be specific to the original version of the Make Noise René
sequencer, but programmed quantization settings do not persist after the module
is powered off. It's not a huge deal to program the desired scale back onto the
module, but I will be honest I sometimes blank on the interval sequence of most
musical scales besides major and minor. Now that I'm more familiar with Figma I
finally put together a cheatsheet PDF of music scales to quickly program them
into the René, which I have taped on the back of my modular case. Each scale is
represented by which knobs that need to be lit in the sequencer grid for easy
programming. The expectation is that your root note is set by the module that
is receiving the quantized voltages.

I've been meaning to make this for a long time and I figured other people would
find this useful. There are two versions: the standard version has various
music scales pre-written with some bonus blank scales at the bottom. I have
also made a fully blank cheatsheet for folks that want more custom scales or
need to remember specific settings for songs. I'm also making the [Figma
file][1] available in case you want to edit it yourself.
