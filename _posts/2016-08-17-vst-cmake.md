After developing two domain-specific language prototypes for music composition
([older][older], [newer solo venture][newer]), I decided to get back into the
signal processing side of music by developing audio plugins. [JUCE][juce] is
easily the most popular platform for this because you can create cross-platform
plugins for VST, Audio Units, AAX, and RTAS from the same codebase. However
this functionality requires using their own build tool, and the documentation
for JUCE can be a little sparse or misleading in some places.

[newer]: https://github.com/gmoe/dsl-prototype
[juce]: https://www.juce.com/

To get a better understanding of how these audio plugin formats work and to
sharpen my C/C++ skills, I decided to write my own VST plugin without the aid
of JUCE. I chose [CMake][cmake] as my build tool for this project because
cross-platform support is crucial to the success of audio plugins.

While I continue to work on one of my plugin concepts, I decided I would
release the [template][template] I created to facilitate the development
process. The template is a functional duplicate of the "AGain" gain changer
example project that ships with the VST SDK. Instead of providing a Visual
Studio or Xcode project it uses CMake to generate the Visual Studio and Xcode
project files. The template can also build plugins for Linux (Steinberg does
not provide templates for Linux, so this is bonus), and has install scripts for
Windows and Unix.

In the future I might create an equivalent template for Audio Units, or update
this template to the newer (but less industry-supported) VST3 API. For now, you
can down the template from the link below:
