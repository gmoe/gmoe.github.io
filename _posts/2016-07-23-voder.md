I'm a huge fan of the 99% Invisible podcast, and one of the first episodes that
got me into the series was [Vox Ex Machina][99pi]. The episode was about the
Voder, an early example of voice synthesis that Bell Laboratories demonstrated
at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Operating the Voder required almost a year a
training, as each formant and syllable is formed by hand at the same rate as
human speech. You can see the Voder being operated by Helen Harper from [this
YouTube video][yt]. Helen Harper went on to run a school instructing 300
students on how to use the Voder, only 30 of whom became skilled enough to
produce fluid speech.

I was so impressed by the technology and the talented women who operated the
Voder that I delved into a bit of research into how it works. After reading the
[patent application][patent] to figure out how it worked, I decided to create a
stripped down emulation of the Voder as an homage to Helen Harper and her
students. It exists as a web application the leverages the Web Audio API, which
is still in the draft stage so it has limited support for mobile devices and
older browsers. I tried to recreate the console of the Voder as best as I could
using the computer keyboard, which works well for building formants but not
controlling the pitch and texture of the voice like in the authentic Voder. The
aspect I'm most proud of is the visual design, which is a recreation of the
original pamphlet distributed at the 1939 World's Fair.

I intend to redesign the console when mobile devices have better support for
the Web Audio API, but until then if you're on a laptop you can go to the link
