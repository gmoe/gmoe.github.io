I have become quite fond of the [Faust](http://faust.grame.fr/) programming
language, itâ€™s a functional programming language that lets you quickly design
audio processing and synthesis algorithms. What makes it interesting as a
programming language is that signals are treated as discrete functions of time,
so when you write a function it becomes second-order function over the signal.
Plus it compiles to super-efficient C++ code with support for CoreAudio, Qt,
GTK, VST, and Audio Units!

Since it is so easy to develop for I have been using Vim to write all of my
code, but the syntax highlighting file included in the Faust repository was
incomplete and had a few bugs. I extended the original file into a plugin with
support for [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim), MathDoc highlighting, and a few
other improvements. Check out the repository on
[GitHub](http://gmoe.github.io/vim-faust).
