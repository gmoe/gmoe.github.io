      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Sound is my deepest passion, it has driven everything I've done. It
        has led me towards a number of fruitful projects, including creating
        and teaching a computer music class at my alma mater. I'm also the
        co-founder of <a href="https://lute.luc.edu/">LUTE</a>, a technology
        ensemble with a focus on accessibility.

      <h2>VODER</h2>
      <p>
        The VODER was an early form of speech synthesis designed by Bell Labs and demonstrated
        at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Requiring a human operator, Helen Harper was the first
        person to learn how to play it. Put yourself in her shoes and try to operate this simulation
        of the original console.
